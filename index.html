  <p id="p1"> I like Greg heffley because he is very funny. He is my favourite character and talks about funny things like his brother. He also teaches us many things and helps us like

     Helps: Motivation in all aspects of life is important, and providing students with a purpose for reading pushes them to seek other books later

    His stories are verry funny and great for 10 years. I am also ten years and I love all the stories of Greg Heffley. He is my favourite character.

    <h1>Personality about Greg Heffley</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p id="para">Greg Heffley is mischievous, lazy, paranoid, arrogant, and dishonest. He is known to become jealous easily. He also tends to be a poor friend, something even he agrees with. He doesn't like taking the blame for negative events, and attempts to twist any situation he can in his favor, so that he may go up his "popularity ladder." Despite all of these negative traits, he has displayed a kinder side. Throughout the series, Greg's schemes to acquire money and popularity always backfire. He also enjoys playing video games, particularly the fictional "Twisted Wizard".
        <br>
<br>
His best friend is Rowley Jefferson (they often get into arguments). Rowley takes part in Greg's schemes and is sometimes a victim of Greg's manipulation and deception. The two have a very complicated relationship, as Greg sometimes takes advantage of Rowley's good nature, and his own schemes fail due to Rowley's foolishness, such as Rowley's "confession" to the vandalized wall. Rowley's parents, mostly his father, view Greg as a bad influence on their son. This is because Greg has a tendency for getting himself and Rowley into trouble. In 'Wrecking Ball', it is revealed that Greg truly does have a soft spot for Rowley, as Greg cries when it is time to say goodbye to him.
<br>
        <br>
At school, Greg receives bad grades, gets bullied, deals with the hardships of middle school, and is always trying to earn popularity points in order to gain attention and respect (though his plans to do so often result in either his own popularity dropping, or unintentionally boosting Rowley's popularity). At home, Greg has a mixed relationship with his family, especially with his younger brother Manny, who is overly pampered and protected by his parents (particularly his mother Susan). His mother tries to devise ways for Greg and his older brother Rodrick to get along but which never work out. Greg's father, Frank, is annoyed by Greg's antics and laziness and tries to make him more active. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Greg has a love/hate relationship with his older brother, Rodrick. Greg is often tormented and bullied by Rodrick and is also the victim of his pranks yet they do care for each other deep down. In addition, he has inherited many of Rodrick's traits (such as laziness, large ego, disdain for sports, being a trickster, etc.). In fact, many of Greg's teachers dislike him because they originally had Rodrick as a student even though Greg's classroom behavior does not mirror Rodrick's. Greg is a fan of video games and comic books and he sees them as talents, which annoys his father Frank. His greatest gift is for cartooning and dry humor, evidenced by the many comic strips he has drawn.

        <h2> I am working to find the best and the funniest book but most of the books that I have read are nothing compared to the Diary Of The Wimpy Kid. It is a very funny book and I recommend it for children above 8 years. I was trying to search to search the internet about the best book for children around 10 years and this was the book thet I found. It is my favourite book and the funniest I have read. What I think is that funny books are better than other types of books because they fill children with laughter and happiness. If you scroll down you will find Gallery and if you click it you will be in a gallery with photos of the the character Greg heffley. Once again It is the funniest book!  </h2>
